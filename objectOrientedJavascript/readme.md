# Object-Oriented-Javascript

#### 1. Plain Old Javascript

**Keypoints:** 

* All key values will be stringified
* properties that doesn't exist will always return undefined instead of showing any kind of errors.
* the value of an object could be anything, i.e string, number, array, object, function, arrowfunction anything.

#### 2. Class Basics

**Keypoints:** 

* ECMAScript 2015 aka ES6 introduced Javascript Javascript.
* **Classes :** We define the blueprint which is the class and then we can create objects baesd off that blueprint aka instances.
* to avoid confusion we initiate the class name with Capital Letters.
* an instance we created will return as object if we try to find the type of it
* to check whether it is instace of a particular type we can use instaceof
* **Constructors :**  is way to initialize properties and is automatically called when there is a new instance of the class.
